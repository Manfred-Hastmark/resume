# Resume

This repository contains the source latex files for my resume. The template I created my resume from 
is forked from the [latexcv](https://github.com/jankapunkt/latexcv) repository, from which I used the *sidebarleft*-template.
The actual resume can be found [here](sidebarleft/main.pdf) and below you can see a preview of the first page.

## How to build (docker)?

We now have a Dockerfile you can use to build your latex environment. 
For this you need to have Docker installed on your system.

Get Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

We provide scripts for building the image and running the containers, 
so you should fine by simply running the `build.sh` script:

```shell
$ .docker/create_image.sh
```

You should now be able to build CVs simply by providing the folder name:

```shell
$ .docker/build.sh classic
```

Constraints: You need to be in the top-level folder of this project and the image has been created (see prior step).
